# 3.4 - Flask application

This project aims to develop a tool for documenting and applying visual identities with the help of generative design. I've been working on this project since 2022, when I created a prototype using javaScript(P5.js) and conducted initial user and market research better to understand the state of brand consistency in visual design. In this software, a group of users will input a design system and defines the rules by which the tool will generate layout variations. D.emo will allow users with less visual design expertise to create visual communication while keeping brand consistency.

Since I already had some understanding of HTML and CSS basic functionalities, in this exercise, I explored some concepts that I needed clarification on, like CSS variables, flexbox parameters, writing a good HTML structure, and CSS responsiveness. Creating this login flow allowed me to test some initial ideas for this product. For sure, there are many good practices that I still need to learn regarding front-end development, so let me know how I could optimize this code.
